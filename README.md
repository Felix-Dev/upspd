uPSPD
=====

uPSPD (unofficial PSP documentation) is a project of making a full documentation for PSP.

This project was started because PSP lacks a good documentation - the only acceptable one is yapspd but it's clearly not up to date.

So, with all the discoveries we wanted to centralize, some discovered in [https://github.com/uofw/uofw](uOFW) and others we found on the Internet, we decided to make this documentation.

The documentation can be accessed through the "Wiki" tab of this page.

## How to contribute?

You can simply fork this repository, change the wiki content of your repository and ask for a pull request.

As soon as you have contributed something through a pull request, you will most likely be granted access to modify this wiki directly.

## Where can documentation be found?

You can find useful information to complete this documentation there:

- [http://ps2dev.org/](ps2dev.org), another website and mostly forum which holds a lot of information too
- [http://wololo.net/](wololo.net), a blog and forum about more PSP stuff
- SBORPS, SilverSpring's former blog, now down but you should be able to find things in web archives
- http://mrmrice.fx-world.org/vfpu.html, with information about the VFPU
- http://wiki.fx-world.org/doku.php?do=index, with details about the VFPU instructions and registers, attacked by spambots, but the information still should be there
