uPSPD
=====

uPSPD (unofficial PSP documentation) is a project of making a full documentation for PSP.

This project was started because PSP lacks a good documentation - the only acceptable one is yapspd but it's clearly not up to date.

So, with all the discoveries we wanted to centralize, some discovered in [https://github.com/uofw/uofw](uOFW) and others we found on the Internet, we decided to make this documentation.

The documentation can be accessed through the "Wiki" tab of this page.

## How to contribute?

You can simply directly edit a wiki page and save it; it should open a pull request automatically.

As soon as you have contributed something through a pull request, you will most likely be granted access to modify this wiki directly.

## Where can documentation be found?

You can find useful information to complete this documentation there:
- [YAPSPD](http://hitmen.c02.at/files/yapspd/psp_doc.pdf.tar.gz), the best and most complete current documentation
- [LAN.ST](http://lan.st/), a forum with very interesting things about PSP
- [ps2dev.org](http://ps2dev.org/) (archive [here](http://lukasz.dk/mirror/forums.ps2dev.org/)), another website and mostly forum which holds a lot of information too
- [wololo.net](http://wololo.net), a blog and forum about more PSP stuff
- SBORPS, SilverSpring's former blog, now down but you should be able to find things in web archives
- http://mrmrice.fx-world.org/vfpu.html, with information about the VFPU
- http://wiki.fx-world.org/doku.php?do=index, with details about the VFPU instructions and registers, attacked by spambots, but the information still should be there
- [Kirk engine](http://code.google.com/p/kirk-engine/), a project of imitating KIRK's behavior, holding information about how it works
