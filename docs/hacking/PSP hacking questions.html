 ive been around psp's for a while and im getting interested with homebrew apps on them (i have a 3001). anywho, im a pretty decent delphi/pascal coder but i haven't ever used C, and it appears that's the only language that works on psp's right?  just to clear things up, psp's will run foreign code fine it just wont launch it, that's why you run homebrew through legit psp games with exploits right?, and the reason we cant run homebrew is because our homebrew isn't kirk-signed right. (kirk is...? hardware? what?)<br />
now, game/buffer overflow exploits are usermode, how would i go about finding kernel exploits, how would i even start to look for them? one last question, how did Pandora's battery put psp's into service mode, and how the hell did he come up with that idea? (do psp 3000's even have a service mode? or is it gone completely?)<br />

Yes I know but when you are in the vsh you have access to the kernel, so if you find an exploit in the vsh then you have a kernel exploit, right?</div></div><hr />

The reason VSH exploits are desirable is because they are normally portable media based, this means that users don't have to go out and buy a game in order to execute their exploit, take ChickHEN for example, that utilised a TIFF file exploit and was as simple as placing the image in the appropriate directory along with a binary file in the root of the MS.

Tyranid's speech at the CCC answers partly to this question:<br />

Also any subject involving &quot;nem&quot; on ps2dev.org is likely to have partial answers to this. Here is an explanation by nem himself:<br />

(i read and watched the links wololo posted,)<br />
@some1: so service mode still exists we just can't get to it, (right?); sony can, so its gotta be possible. <br />
<br />
[thinking out loud]<br />
<br />
lets assume sony gets a broken(flash) psp (3001).<br />
lets also assume sony made it easy to fix (eg. don't need to open it up).<br />
<br />
possible ways to access it (IO stuffs):<br />
1:usb<br />
2:-wireless<br />
3:memorystick<br />
4:-audio/headset plug/video <br />
5:-power plug<br />
6:-umd<br />
7:battory<br />
<br />
if the flash is dead so im guessing wireless, UMD, audio/video are out, and you cant really do anything with the power plug.<br />
okay that leaves us with usb, battery and memstick (who would have guessed?). <br />
[/thinking out loud]<br />
<br />
its pretty safe to say that sony still uses some type of battery to get into service mode right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cloudhunter</div><div class="date">05-22-2010, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I imagine it's a memory stick combined with something else. Don't forget there is also the serial port (where the video out connectors are).<br />
<br />
However, even if we can get into service mode we still have the ipl signing issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flyer</div><div class="date">05-22-2010, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think it's usb+memstick</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cloudhunter</div><div class="date">05-22-2010, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't necessarily need to be a driver. syscon could just detect a signal on a pin - not necessarily a full usb connection. After all, the pre-ipl for slim and fat don't have any battery reading code - they simply detect something set by syscon.<br />
<br />
When that has been done, service mode could probably be completed using a memory stick, similar to what is done with the battery.</div></div><hr />

as far as i know, you can execute c/c++, basic, lua, delphi, python... i think thats it</div></div><hr />

 you can execute delphi on a psp? (thats great news for me :D) umm, how? there is no delphi-pspsdk.<br />
[edit]<br />
okay so i read up about datels lite blue thing and it does indeed put 300x's into service mode you just cant do anything from there. so that kind of answered one of my q's.</div></div><hr />

No, you can't, afaik. USB protocol is way more complicated than a serial transfer. And Syscon has no direct access to USB pins, unlike battery pins.<br />
<br />
You can run any programming language on PSP that has a compiler/interpreter for PSP. As with everything else :P</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's not USB. It'll be through it's special port. No doubt some of the lines are connected to the syscon.<br />
<br />

Actually VSH exploits are desirable because of ulevel 4, which means you can access the VSH API.</div></div><hr />

yes, i thought that was pretty obvious.<br />
i figure if you somehow send a malformed packet the psp reading it wouldn't know how to handle it and give you a buffer over flow, crash or something</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did some tests, you can't send a corrupted/unsupported image, and if you receive a corrupted/unsupported image then it won't display it, and if it can't display it you can't exit the image to save it, and if you can't save it then you probably can't do much(so don't try sending chickhen to another psp because it won't work), so I'm not sure if there is much to look at here...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not too clear on what that is, but I was speaking from a user's POV, in that a VSH media exploit is a case of &quot;Download the file, allow the PSP to attempt to parse it, exploit executed, done&quot;, and also the fact that this way, no cost is incurred buying a game, from a developers POV, Extra &quot;stuff&quot; (ulevel4) is more desirable I guess.<br />
<br />
Usually those protocol stacks (like CSMA/CA) are extensively tested, and most likely used in other Sony devices. It would be hard finding a flaw there. Same goes for TCP/IP.<br />
<br />
I've often wondered how well the PSP handles malformed WiFi data, but as m0skit0 says, all of the protocols associated with online communications appear to be solid :(</div></div><hr />

do psp's have running processes (ex, windows has wininet, winlogon, explorer) (that's what .prx's and .elf are right?) if so do we know what they are named (the system ones)?</div></div><hr />

PSP has no processes, but threads, since it doesn't have a MMU.<br />
<br />
that's what .prx's and .elf are right?<br />
You don't have to mix executables (PRXs are ELFs btw) with processes, they're 2 different (but related) things. Executables contain the process image, but also a lot of additional data needed to actually set up the code to be running. So no, ELFs are not processes.<br />
<br />
if so do we know what they are named (the system ones)?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Did you ever used PSPLINK from Tyranid? If not I suggest you get used to it because it's the basic PSP hacker/developer tool. Of course that requires a CFW'd PSP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&gt;_&gt; the reason i asked is because i had an idea to get kernel access, i don't know c, but i can do it in pascal. (i also don't know what pspsdk api's are limited to, so it may not be possible)<br />
but it requires knowing a 'process' that the psp needs to run [any kernel level process really]. <br />
<br />
*i use the word process loosely because i know psp's don't run like windows i just need to compare it to something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you insert a battery into a PSP it goes through a pre-power operation which checks the serial number written on the battery EEPROM.<br />
If that serial number is 0x00000000 it will auto turn on and boot from the NAND (Flash0) as normal without you touching the power button, this is known as auto-boot mode. If the battery's serial number is 0xFFFFFFFF then the PSP will power on and boot from the memory stick... This is normal behaviour by the PSP and is by design, the beauty of how/why installing CFW works (Let alone the research that made it possible) is much more complicated.<br />
<br />
Edit: m0skit0 you have much more tolerance than I, here's to taking a leaf out of your book...</div></div><hr />

okay, i actually wrote this for windows not having psp's in mind, but i don't see why you couldn't mod it a little and make it psp-able.<br />
the theory is, if you inject something in to a 'process' (thread) you get all the privileges of that 'process' (thread).<br />
<br />
but like i mentioned above, i don't know what the pspsdk api's are limited to so this may not even be possible.  <br />
known bugs: if run on windows7 writeprocessmemory throws ERROR_PARTIAL_COPY (getlasterror 299), this is a &gt;Vista memory issue i don't know how to fix it (psp's don't run vista so that okay :D)<br />

p.s. if you google this code you'll probably find it posted elsewhere cause i was asking about the ERROR_PARTIAL_COPY error :D <br />
p.p.s i think i found a bug in your forum software.<br />
<br />
ALSO if all else fails this will cause the 'process' (thread) to crash. which is also good i guess?</div></div><hr />

They're absolutely whole different systems. And most important, in Windows you have full privileges over the system, which is not the case on a PSP with OFW. FW has the hand over the user. To resume: you can't inject code into kernel modules without a kernel exploit. So your idea wouldn't work. <br />

I suggest you do some research about PSP internal working, also about how a MIPS CPU operates.<br />

no, not if your not an admin.<br />
besides the beauty of my snippet is you can run it as a limited user and still get privileges of what you injected it in to. (system processes are not something you can usually mess with, but you CAN use this on it)<br />
<br />
you can't inject code into kernel modules without a kernel exploit.<br />

that sounds simple enough but i don't understand. why cant that^ be ran in userland, are X API's just disabled or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">m0skit0</div><div class="date">06-14-2010, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You cannot elevate the privileges by a simple system call like in your example. I've not programmed Pascal for Windows, but that code seems to simply call an API to elevate the privileges of the process. You first call lookupPrivilegeValue() to check current privilege, then just change it calling AdjustTokenPrivileges().<br />
<br />
This is equivalent to having administrator privileges. This is Windows lack of security at work. You cannot do that on Linux for example. Please correct me if I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
For PSP:<br />
When running on a MIPS architecture, there are 2 &quot;segments&quot; of memory: user memory and kernel memory. MIPS addresses are 32-bit long, and bit 31 (32nd bit from LSB to MSB) indicates user/kernel. When set to 0, it's user memory, when set to 1 it's kernel memory. So from 0x00000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF it's user memory, and from 0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF it's kernel. Code running on user memory cannot access kernel memory. MIPS CPU internal circuits check that, so you cannot it fool it (except possible unknown CPU exploit). But code running on kernel memory can access any address with no problem. <br />
<br />
The only way to switch from user to kernel mode is through exceptions, most notably system calls (SYSCALL instruction), which give access to kernel exported functions. If you find an exploitable vulnerability inside those functions, you can actually &quot;inject&quot; your code into kernel memory and then run it, having thus full priveleges over the console since your code now resides on kernel memory.<br />
<br />
I hope this clears it up. If you still think your code can actually run on PSP somehow, I'm all ears.</div></div><hr />

I did eventually figure it out.. It was dialup too.. but since then, I'd rather just have things work in a familiar environment rather than mess around too much... you know what they say, Linux will do absolutely everything you require of it, if time is not an issue for you.<br />

This post drifted off topic a while ago, there has been some general speculation and some interesting snippets, as well as off topic banter, I don't see too much wrong with it as it is :)<br />
<br />
inb4 Mathieulh wades in and slaps this in HOS.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, at that point in time in the UK, hardly anyone knew of linux, even some &quot;professionals&quot; seriously.... the reason I wanted to play with it was because I'd been reading some Americans talking about it on a forum, took me 2 weeks just to get the xserver to work properly, never did get the sound working though.<br />
<br />
Also, while the Americans where running around with their cable modems we all had 56k v92 modems (if we where lucky), there simply wasn't broadband technology installed anywhere, I can remember being requested by my ISP to call up a special number and &quot;Register my interest&quot; for broadband, I called it about 50 times because the Americans liked to ping me offline for fun or send my rockwell +++ATH0 in an ICMP packet... Nostalgic RAGE!!!<br />
<br />
American Guy: &quot;Uh... Max.. can you say buhhhbye?!&quot;<br />
Max: Offline...<br />

Anyway you are right.<br />

<br />
@cracksman, there are many things wrong with your example.<br />
<br />
Firstly, the privileges you are talking about are purely OS-level security. It is something that Windows itself implemented to separate privileges between users. <br />
<br />
The correct Windows/x86 analogy to what m0skit0 is trying to explain (the separation of user/kernel mode via system calls) would be something like this:<br />
<br />
As an example, the ReadFile function (a very common WinAPI call):<br />
<br />
User_mode[app calls ReadFile -&gt; calls the NativeAPI equivalent NtReadFile in kernel32.dll -&gt; calls the processor-dependant trap instruction in ntdll.dll] -&gt; system call software interrupt -&gt; Kernel_mode[calls the real NtReadFile code in ntoskrnl.exe]<br />
<br />
This is how user code reaches kernel code, it is dependant on the architecture: on x86 they use the 'int 0x2E' instruction, more modern Intel x86 cpu's use the 'sysenter' instruction, AMD x86 cpu's use the 'syscall' instruction (they all do the same thing).<br />
<br />
What you have described is the Windows-specific mechanisms of handling access tokens, something which is needed for a multi-user OS. The PSP is NOT a multi-user multitasking OS. Anything using Se* of the WinAPI is part of this Windows security system (the security reference monitor). It has nothing to do with how the PSP OS works.<br />
<br />
On a side note, those WinAPI calls you mentioned work just as well in C (or .net for that matter).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracksman</div><div class="date">06-15-2010, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for clearing that up(although im still a bit confused, probably because im not used to it).<br />
so as an example, on a psp, if you call ReadFile in usermode you can only read things in usermode [eg. kernel is off limits] right?<br />
-<br />
so is there ever a time where any user land api is used in kernel land?<br />
boot time/game launching/game saving/ect<br />
<br />
and how did [whatever] game exploit get kernel access?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">m0skit0</div><div class="date">06-15-2010, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was asking 'if we changed that bit to 1 we would be in kernel right'?<br />
then i asked if that bit (bit 31) was user mode accessible (doubtful).<br />
Programming 101 (BOTH PSP AND PC): your code, when running, is on main memory (RAM), I guess you already knew this. As such, he's at some address when running, for example address X. CPU just fetches the instruction from that address X, executes it, then fetches instruction from address X+1, executes it, and so on.<br />
<br />
What I meant by user/kernel mode on PSP was that if the address of the executing code as bit 31 = 0, then you're on user mode. If it's set to 1, then it's kernel mode. If you change bit 31, you'll end up with a whole different address, and your code will not be there anymore. And anyway, you can't call a kernel space code directly from a user space code, it will raise an invalid address exception. I hope this clears things up. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I suggest you again to check some tutorial about how code actually runs on a machine, at low-level (assembly) so you can understand it better. If you didn't know, everything is translated to machine language to run (even Pascal), as processors only understand that.<br />
<br />
so is there ever a time where any user land api is used in kernel land?<br />
You didn't get what SilverSpring told you. All API code is on kernel land (well I'm bending the truth, but anyways).  So for your code that runs on user mode to be able to call those APIs, he has to switch to kernel mode, which can only be acheived by SYSCALL instruction (which triggers an exception, which is the equivalent of a software interruption for IA32). This SYSCALL has a number, which is handled by the kernel to see what service you've requested, then pass it to the proper kernel function, then use RTE (IRET on IA32) to return from an exception, and back to your user mode code.<br />
<br />
and how did [whatever] game exploit get kernel access?<br />
By finding a vulnerability on a kernel function and exploiting it. If a kernel function accessable through standard PSP API is vulnerable, you can trick it to copy your code into kernel space, then call it using another (or the same) API call. Then you'd be running on kernel space with full privileges.<br />
<br />
Again, I suggest you get to know how programming actually works, because high-level prorgamming for Windows won't yield anything useful on PSP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
couldn't you replace a prx with a modded one with your code? (i don't know much about the innards of psp's as you can see^ but hang with me)<br />
so for example lets pretend there is a note_botton.prx normally when you push the 'note' button this .prx is called and messes with the volume controls. now if you replaced this note_button.prx with your own or patched it to JMP to some code elsewhere, when you push the 'note' button wouldn't your code run? (if it was a kernel .prx would your code be run in kernel land?)</div></div><hr />

(if it was a kernel .prx would your code be run in kernel land?)A kinda similiar exploit was used back in 1.50 firmware, where you were able to swap a prx (from exceptionman till init.prx) with a plain one which must not have any kernel mode attributes or imports. But Sony (of course) fixed that exploit later (1.52?). So in order to get this working in new firmware you'd have to encrypt your prx and flash it. Dead end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To read and write in the flash mem of the PSP you'll need a kernel exploit. <br />
A program in user mode can only read those mem.<br />
<br />
A kernel exploit allows you to read and write, but I don't see the point in doing that if you have a kernel exploit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If memory serves me well, the only thing that protects them is a SHA-1 checksum and some scrambling. They only hold information about the size and information about the extra non-KIRK encryption that PRX's have (eg. XOR with a kernel key). You can change them all you want, it is still going to feed the body of the file to KIRK and won't pass the checks.</div></div><hr />

It's got updater mode, which has certain modules loaded compared to other modes (which can give certain advantages). The updater loads some module which have kernel attributes yes, but the updater runs in updater mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. Plus, there's a module loaded (vshbridge) in updater mode that allows you to load kernel modules from a different location than just flash0, such as from the updater itself (they still have to be signed and encrypted, though). Inside user mode the only place you can load kernel modules from is flash0.</div></div><hr />

No... all it does is provide an API to load SIGNED, ENCRYPTED kernel modules from the memory stick. Also, you can't load it outside of VSH/updater mode.</div></div><hr />

Updater Mode is just User Mode with elevated priveledges ie. load Sony Signed modules off the memory stick and flash0 write access.<br />
<br />
I don't understand what you mean by 'is user mode easier than kernel mode'. AFAIK the PSP never runs in kernel mode, it just interfaces with the kernel through syscalls.<br />
<br />
EDIT if you mean 'is it easier' to find exploits then yes.</div></div><hr />

Sorry m0skit0. I actually made that assumption because the kernel is supposed to always run in the background with threads connecting it to user mode, right? The user interfaces with user mode, and is limited by what the kernel will let them do. It shouldn't ever be truly in kernel mode because that would suggest that the user has full control over the system. Feel free to inform me of why I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

Pandora's Battery was originally used by Sony, it was reversed engineered by hackers. And crashes are examined through PSPLink, but they must be found first in one of the aforementioned vectors aka mp4, mp3, gif, tiff, etc.</div></div><hr />

That was a clue that it had something to do with the battery. It was up to them to confirm it and figure out what it was. It was never reverse engineered. I'm quite sure they never even possessed that battery.</div></div><hr />

Occasionally service memory sticks from Sony service centres turn up, but distributing their contents is illegal, even so that hasn't stopped them ending up in a few peoples collections.</div></div><hr />

Maybe because at first time they used hardmodded batteries, and the resulting value read was FF's. Putting a random value would require a slighlty more complicated hardware. Also might be so they could have a special value not on the middle of serial numbers domain, which would be confusing for third-party manufacturers. Not really worth the effort, as I think Sony was not relying on this serial number as a security feature, but rather on Pre-IPL checks for a valid IPL.</div></div><hr />

I didn't think about it like that... makes sense now, besides... the battery was only security through obscurity, it wasn't a real attempt at a security concept, they left that to the (pre)IPL.</div></div><hr />

P.S. How Brokencodes did it?<br />
<br />
Back in old PSP's it was possible to remove blocks from the IPL because there were blocks that had a zero checksum, and they just so happened to use the value of zero to specify there being no block in front of it. Thus, you could leave a leap of unused memory right at the entry point (as long as the new block at the start had a zero checksum), and if booted to another firmware with a modification chip, stuffed code there and power cycled, it would execute it before the CPU resets to get rid of the pre-IPL. This was fixed in the newer models, however.<br />
<br />
Also, there is no reason at all to assume that Brokencodes had dumped the pre-IPL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ByteMaster</div><div class="date">07-31-2010, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, there is no reason at all to assume that Brokencodes had dumped the pre-IPL.<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, Dark_Alex was working on understanding the extra checksum that was in the IPL; this was a mystery and the pre-IPL was needed to understand how the checksum worked. Since the website is down, I can't link to Dark_Alex's post but this is a quote I found:<br />
<br />
&quot;Summary: basically, all security of newest PSP cpu's rely on the secrecy of the calculation of those 0x20 bytes. If pre-ipl were dumped somehow, the security would go down TOTALLY. &quot;<br />
<br />
Edit: it can be found here:<br />
http://www.psp-hacks.com/2008/10/06/why-psp-motherboard-ta88v3-cannot-be-hacked-yet/<br />
<br />
Again IIRC, Brokencodes purported to know how this checksum worked (source was posted as well, I have this somewhere but not on this computer), and in further analysis Dark_Alex said it was code &quot;to forge a portion of the IPL signature block&quot; but not the entire thing (as per Sceners.org but that is also down ATM so no link).<br />
<br />
Even when the IPL is figured out, on TA-088v3 and higher we still need a method to put the PSP in service mode, which the infamous 'blue lite tool' was purported to do (whether through a &quot;crypto processor&quot; or doing some funny stuff with the voltage level is still unknown).</div></div><hr />

May anyone reupload despertar 7 source code?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bubbletune</div><div class="date">07-31-2010, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, there is no reason at all to assume that Brokencodes had dumped the pre-IPL.<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, Dark_Alex was working on understanding the extra checksum that was in the IPL; this was a mystery and the pre-IPL was needed to understand how the checksum worked.<br />
He posted information he found after taking a look at the new IPL format, I have my doubts that he was actually working on cracking it.<br />
<br />
Again IIRC, Brokencodes purported to know how this checksum worked (source was posted as well, I have this somewhere but not on this computer), and in further analysis Dark_Alex said it was code &quot;to forge a portion of the IPL signature block&quot; but not the entire thing (as per Sceners.org but that is also down ATM so no link).<br />
<br />
I never really took a close look, but it could've been so that SCE was just using a standard hashing algromithm and Brokencodes found it by trial-and-error, or something similiar to that. If he had dumped the pre-ipl he would've had more information, not just a part.<br />
<br />
Even when the IPL is figured out, on TA-088v3 and higher we still need a method to put the PSP in service mode, which the infamous 'blue lite tool' was purported to do (whether through a &quot;crypto processor&quot; or doing some funny stuff with the voltage level is still unknown).<br />
<br />
You can still use custom IPL blocks to write custom firmwares, even if you don't have service mode. :p Also, there's probably a clue to how service mode is enabled on these new models in the pre-IPL.<br />
<br />
A little side-note before people forget: Custom IPL blocks use an exploit in the pre-IPL. There is no reason to assume that the new checksum is the only change. It's good security as it stops you from downgrading to older firmwares alltogether and it invalidates current custom IPL blocks, but the chances that they actually fixed the exploit are large, in which case calcuating the hash using code reversed from a pre-IPL dump won't get us any closer.</div></div><hr />

we can dump memory correct? so couldn't someone dump mem when kirk is run, then step through the ASM to see how it works? (reverse it kindof like how you would make a keygen, then implant that in our homebrew)</div></div><hr />

Have a one-week ban and take some time off (hopefully it'll do you good). I've put off banning you for a long time, one more stupid-ass post from you and you get a permanent IP ban.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't like to attempt to code homebrew to do that...<br />

Besides, cracking a particular input isn't what we're after, what we want to know is the algorithms associated with the encryption and signing process, brute force isn't an option.</div></div><hr />

I was just using the ps3 as an example.<br />
@MaxMouseDLL You're saying it can be done, but it would be kinda useless?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't even think you can brute force it... we don't even know the algorithm (encryption/signing) to attempt it.<br />
<br />
We need to know the steps from an unencrypted piece of data to it's encrypted and signed version... we simply don't know them... brute force is useless in this instance, even if it where useful the fact that it's encrypted AND signed would increase the possibilities exponentially, meaning that you'd probably need more people running this thing than the population of earth (Depending on the size of data you're trying to brute force).<br />
<br />
You'd need an infinite amount of monkeys, sitting at an infinite amount of computers, typing for an infinite amount of time... you'd get your encryption and signing algorithm... you'd also get the complete works of Shakespeare and everything else ever written, being written or ever will be written... but that's besides the point... <br />
<br />
They brute forced some blocks of the IPL, that's how pandora works...<br />
<br />
Edit: What we need to do is write some code that allows access to the flashes and the capability of running unsigned code, then somehow have Sony sign it, this kind of thing happened recently with the iPhone, a guy made a crappy flash light app, but hid inside it some code to allow tethering... apple made it available on the appstore and boom, everyone that downloaded it had restriction-less tethering. Apple discovered their screw up and tore the app down... but it's a cool demonstration of covert capabilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are companies (Like Chipworks) which will decap IC's for you and provide you with a detailed report for reverse engineering, there are legitimate reasons for this kind of service (A company that has developed an IC for you, but has then gone bust, or you inherit some hardware and have no idea how it works...) - (I've tried, they (Chipworks) won't speak to me), even so... even if we had this kind of information... we'd be hard pressed to understand it, and I'm told it probably wouldn't be enough anyway.</div></div><hr />

I already tried this, I was going to approach Mathieu to see if I could steal a spare PSP (or two) from him to send to Chipworks, but after an initial conversation with Chipworks they decided to ignore me, so I couldn't even start trying to raise funds, why don't you give it a shot, see if you have more luck.<br />
<br />
Edit: it's like this (1 + 2) = 3 where (1 + 2) is decrypted data, 3 is encrypted and signed data, explain that to me assuming you have no concept of numbers (Encryption) or math (Signing)... all you're left with is the fact that a given input gives a certain output... you cannot describe how it works, just that it works... it's what's known as a &quot;Black box&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esteban</div><div class="date">08-12-2010, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any reason they started ignoring you, Max?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a think about it... say for example that I managed to raise the funds, Mathieul gave me 3 PSP's for the project, I send them all to chipworks, they send me back a complete rundown of every IC in the thing, we find someone who knows how to interpret the data, he gives us back the encryption and signing algorithms... overnight we can legitimately sign and encrypt our own homebrew, and because of backward compatibility Sony can do nothing about it, their security has gone down TOTALLY, there is now nothing they can do to stop us.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, Sony find out who's responsible for giving us this information.. Chipworks.... you think they want to be involved in that war? hell no... they want Joe soap, who's just took over a business.. has some hardware and isn't on great terms with it's developers, he owns the rights to the hardware so they reverse engineer it for him, everyone is happy... everyone gets paid..<br />
<br />

<br />
When the PSP is &quot;dead&quot; something like this may surface... or maybe when Sony deems the PSP to be dead they will leak it...<br />
<br />
Say for example Sony leave the PSP which they eventually will... running homebrew/(lets face it) pirate games on it, may garner them some revenue... The PSP's death throws may be just that... but not for a long time yet.<br />
<br />
The homebrew scene will die... the PSP will die.... once it's all said and done, it might be in Sony's interest to tell all... I hope so...</div></div><hr />

PSP 3000's that came with 5.70 are actually PSP 4000's. All it'd help would be slim users and early 3000 users.<br />

<br />
Firstly, that is for PSP 3000's that have been originally set with firmware 5.70. What about all the other PSP's originally set to 4.01(first firmware?) and others? However, I guess in the end, I would just create more pirates then people creating homebrew =/<br />
<br />
Second, if these kernel exploits are patched on newer firmwares, whats the harm in their release? It would just bump people up to a new firmware, or even bring the CFW to the PSP Go? There are still many possibilities with these exploits, and I'm pretty sure that the current scene would be sincere on their release. But I guess it would make sense, not much of a point with the things released now.......</div></div><hr />

okay i apologize too, but please think about psp go user like me, why until this day,and it almost a year we can't play iso or something, and i just can play homebrew, but now i will get boring about homebrew cause in my country in indonesia download game for psp is more expensive, price of the game is from 300.000 IDR until 600.000 IDR. and if we use our psp go for downgrade or hacking will brick my psp,cause now no more sony center service in indonesia so please think about us!(sorry for my bad english)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think there is a saying in English &quot;beggers are not choosers&quot; or something like that, which means that if you want to hack your PSP, you should start doing it yourself.<br />
<br />
I know, it's easier said than done, but consider this: nowadays, to hack a PSP through software, you need to already have a hacked PSP.<br />
It means ALL hackers already have at least one hacked PSP.<br />
<br />
Now, think about it yourself: if you had a hacked PSP, would you be actively looking for exploits? The answer is: most people who have a hacked PSP don't care at all about other users. So, before asking if hackers &quot;care&quot; about PSP Go users, buy a hackable PSP yourself, and see if you still care about the sake of other users (not enough money? Sell your Go and buy a used Phat, you will even make money). If you do, then you are &quot;good enough&quot; to ask that kind of question. Otherwise, you're just egotistic, like most people (and unlike hackers).<br />
<br />
That's what PSP hackers do on a daily basis: work for others, not for themselves, because they already have a hacked PSP. So don't think hackers &quot;don't care&quot; about the others. As a matter of fact, hackers probably care more about the hackable status of THE psp Go than PSP go owners themselves, who only care about the hackable status of THEIR psp go.<br />
<br />
In other words, if you truly want the psp go to be hacked, you need to buy a hackable PSP. Ironic, isn't it? :D<br />
<br />
You can also blame yourself for your initial choices...why did you buy a psp go in the first place? you knew it was a unhacakble system. Or, if you didn't, you should have researched more before buying.<br />
<br />
By the way, I'm not trying to be insulting you or anything, I'm just saying that it's easy to forget that the hackers community don't owe anything to the psp scene, and that anyone who really wants to can become a hacker. Hackers don't have superpowers. Just a hackable PSP (LESS expensive than a psp go, so you can't use money as a justification for not buying one) and a brain (ships by default on most humans models).</div></div><hr />

I lol'd yea, they ship the hardware by default... but 90~99% of that hardware comes pre-installed with terrible firmware, and in my case... more bad blocks than it should have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DSwizzy145</div><div class="date">08-18-2010, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but what about the PSP Go users who buy a psp where they are above expectations given by one of hacker after two days the console came out? <br />
<br />
I think there is a saying in English &quot;beggers are not choosers&quot; or something like that, which means that if you want to hack your PSP, you should start doing it yourself.<br />
<br />
I know, it's easier said than done, but consider this: nowadays, to hack a PSP through software, you need to already have a hacked PSP.<br />
It means ALL hackers already have at least one hacked PSP.<br />
<br />
Now, think about it yourself: if you had a hacked PSP, would you be actively looking for exploits? The answer is: most people who have a hacked PSP don't care at all about other users. So, before asking if hackers &quot;care&quot; about PSP Go users, buy a hackable PSP yourself, and see if you still care about the sake of other users (not enough money? Sell your Go and buy a used Phat, you will even make money). If you do, then you are &quot;good enough&quot; to ask that kind of question. Otherwise, you're just egotistic, like most people (and unlike hackers).<br />

i know it =) I'd like to play on 5.55 with MOHH &amp; kexploit, but i don't have second one.<br />
May be someone have useless in 6.xx kexploit [than may be used with MOHH exploit on 5.55]?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">m0skit0</div><div class="date">08-23-2010, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You said 6.XX, not 5.55 :P Also if you want to play with 5.55, why you want a 6.XX kxploit? You make no sense.<br />
<br />
And anyways, if you're waiting someone to give you a 6.XX kxploit, then you'd better take a comfortable seat and wait around.<br />
<br />
People these days...</div></div><hr />

Patched in 6.xx and not patched in 5.xx [up to 5.55].</div></div><hr />
