		<description>Using psp 3k with OFW 5.03 , I&#039;ve been trying to load ChickHEN R2 and ChickHEN R2 Mod2 for days, still it doesnt work. Interesting really. Wondering if the memory sticks have effect , - using 16gb sandisk -</description>

		<description>This random padding is simply done to make it harder to succesfully run such overflow exploits, didn&#039;t the first one was found some firmware versions before 2.50?</description>

		<description>That&#039;s a good explanation SilverSpring. I always wondered that. Thank you very much!</description>

		<description>The time it took to load all modules until vshbridge? that seems a little half-arsed to me... even so, my unit boots chickhen without issue 100% of the time.</description>

		<description>It&#039;s because it hasn&#039;t got anything to do with the actual system time, but the time it took to load up all modules till it reached vshbridge. There is various factors that can affect this, including, but not limited to, memory stick initialization. This may be why these so-called stability packs and instructions on removing files seem to work, but the truth is it differs heavily between PSP&#039;s.</description>

		<description>This explains why people have to reboot a few times before getting it to work, not why some people try hundreds of times with no success and have to change their config settings to get it to work...

Also, why did Sony implement this? Against hackers? It doesn&#039;t look like a good protection... 
(compared to the cycling they perform on the framebuffer&#039;s 4th byte of each address)</description>

		<description>I agree with thedicemaster, i can boot the HEN 100% of the time without fail at all times of the day/night, why is this?</description>

		<description>Try booting hen at different times of the day and see if your luck holds out.


Very informative article, i had no idea Sony used random memory padding.</description>
