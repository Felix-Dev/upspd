		<description>Well regarding that new model, it seems they hadn&#039;t fixed the preipl exploit. The problem lie elsewhere (something else in that IC changed but not the preipl). Though on newer slim IPL&#039;s there is a SYSCON-based challenge-response setup that&#039;s used to generate keys which might be timing critical and may depend on certain paramaters within the CPU IC. This might have something to do with it. But more tests need to be done on these new models to see what exactly it is that changed within that IC (so far it doesn&#039;t seem to be the preipl).</description>

		<description>I&#039;m thinking preipl is in Mask ROM, at least on older PSP CPUs. 
As seen http://forums.maxconsole.net/showthread.php?t=117432 here, TA-088 V2 has a new Pandora-proof (C) 2007 CPU.
Since clearly Sony really did want to lockout/defeat Pandora, badly enough to push a new CPU, I think that had preipl been in OTP PROM on the older PSP models they would have pushed an update to manufacturing and we would have seen Pandora-proof PSPs much sooner.
Maybe it&#039;s in OTP PROM now though, interesting thought...</description>

		<description>Yes, I presume it&#039;s referring to an OTP PROM on the die. Something that is programmed at the factory, the ID being a completely unique serial. It might also suggest that the &#039;preipl&#039; is stored on an OTP PROM as well and not a mask ROM.</description>

		<description>Fuses as in CPU die fuses, or something completely unrelated to that line of thought?</description>
