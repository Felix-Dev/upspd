		<description>Really really... the datasheet&#039;s plausible uses for the pinout matches up very very well. The way they mess with the silkscreens and occasionally use clones in mass runs though, I have no 100% certainty aside from the fact in over 2hrs searching it was the only thing close I could find.</description>

		<description>Really really???? It&#039;s a 78K core??
Because...well...that&#039;s *very* interesting...:p</description>

		<description>I figured it might be a bit much to ask that it all be easily usable on a single bus :(

To the best of my knowledge the batteries are using a (or possibly, since the logo is MIA, a clone of the) NEC 78K0/KB1+ (8-Bit Single-Chip Microcontrollers) - the operation of the pins is configurable, I2C (among others) is listed as one of the available options on the 780102H, some pins (as well as package specs) line up to well to the datasheets, and the application seems pretty accurate for what it was made for.</description>

		<description>Do you know which micro the battery uses? The comm line is a 1-wire async serial, so it&#039;s not I2C.

Syscon probably has I2C (as a master to other devices) but it wont be on the same bus as the CPU I2C bus, the only I2C slave devices the CPU controls is the clock generator (addr 0xD2), the audio codec (addr 0x34), and the video out IC on slim (addr 0x42).</description>

		<description>Is the battery mc (IIRC the spec of the serial lead coming off the controller from the battery would fall in line with I2C) not on the I2C bus as well, with syscon obscuring/simplifying it? meh, syscon probably doles out I2C anyway.</description>
