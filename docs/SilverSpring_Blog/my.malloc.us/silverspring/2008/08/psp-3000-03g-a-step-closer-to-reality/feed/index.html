		<description>Interestingly enough, they seem to have filed a request for temporary confidentiality on 7 July &#039;08, asking for 45 days of confidentiality on their internal/external/test photos and manual.

The FTC listing doesn&#039;t show any requests for renewal, so we might be seeing those docs soon :)</description>
