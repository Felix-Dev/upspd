		<description>@cory1492: things seem to only make it if 1) prototypes are completely figured out and 2) sample usage code to demonstrate the proper usage. Anyway, it is unlikely any more will be added to PSPSDK since it can already do pretty much everything the SCESDK can do (which is the intent anyway). So pretty much all the user libs only, like ctrl, display, etc. Kernel libs are not really needed for homebrew dev, there are not really many kernel libs in the PSPSDK at all (the idstorage lib comes to mind but that&#039;s about it).

@mr305: that should probably be possible though I&#039;m not sure if there would be anything of value looking through it. Regarding USB Host mode, there is still no evidence to suggest so.</description>

		<description>I was wondering... Is it NOT POSSIBLE to READ firmware already present in the Camera? 
We could figure out FOR SURE if the USB is really not in host mode.</description>
