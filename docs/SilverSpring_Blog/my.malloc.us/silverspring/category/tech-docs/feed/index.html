			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> This is just the first draft just to give you an idea of what these &#8220;tech docs&#8221; are going to be like. It&#8217;s on the PSP Boot Sequence.</p>
<p>And to quote before:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;It will be fairly technical but it is aimed at the general psp user and explained in a way that everyone can understand while at the same time trying to be as detailed as possible. Though I will assume that the reader has a general knowledge of terms like ‘Nand’, ‘IPL’, ‘Idstorage’, etc.</em></p>
<p><em>Hopefully, this will be useful for not only general users wanting to gain a better understanding of the PSP, but also devs looking for some detailed reference material.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://silverspring.lan.st/NPSPTD_01.txt" title="NPSPTD Article01"><strong>http://silverspring.lan.st/NPSPTD_01.txt</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>EDIT: </strong>First drafts of Articles 02 &amp; 03 will be posted soon. Topic will be &#8220;2.60+ IPL Encryption&#8221; &amp; &#8220;3.00+ Nand Encryption&#8221; respectively. Future articles I&#8217;m planning to write will include Idstorage Keys, the KIRK crypto engine, and that &#8220;other secret&#8221; crypto engine.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because there is a general lack of detailed PSP System documentation available (YAPSPD is excellent and is <em>the </em>definitve PSP HW docs <a href="http://hitmen.c02.at/files/yapspd/psp_doc/frames.html">http://hitmen.c02.at/files/yapspd/psp_doc/frames.html</a>, but unfortunately is no longer updated), I&#8217;ll be writing up some technical articles for the general public. Topics will vary but will generally be detailed low level information that isnt publically available anywhere else.</p>
<p>It will be fairly technical but it is aimed at the general psp user and explained in a way that everyone can understand while at the same time trying to be as detailed as possible. Though I will assume that the reader has a general knowledge of terms like &#8216;Nand&#8217;, &#8216;IPL&#8217;, &#8216;Idstorage&#8217;, etc.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will be useful for not only general users wanting to gain a better understanding of the PSP, but also devs looking for some detailed reference material.</p>
