		<description>How will having a hard drive or bluetooth make it a &#039;dream handheld&#039;?

I just don&#039;t see it. In fact these are probably the last things I&#039;d want to see in a portable console. Reliability and far better battery life seem the antithesis of putting a hard drive and BT in there.</description>

Dammit, Sony...</description>

		<description>@cory1492:
Ah the completely useless (officially that is) irda, well one could be forgiven for forgetting that such a (officially) useless device even existed.

@codes02 (nice to hear from you again):
From a purely HW point of view, the motherboard should already be able to support the hdd without modifications. If the hdd were going to be internal (which it was from the looks of the tiny new Samsung hdd the rumours purported), then probably something as simple as just soldering the connecting cables to the various points on the motherboard.</description>

		<description>Very interesting, SilverSpring. I brings me to wonder what additional hardware they would need to design to interface those parts.

Though i can&#039;t say i&#039;m too much of a hard drive fan, the bluetooth would have been quite interesting.</description>

		<description>Funny you don&#039;t mention things that were taken out of the &quot;phat&quot; on the slim, like the pretty much completely unused IR port (a la 1394/HDD on PS2 redesign.) Perhaps they are finally learning?</description>
