		<description>What do you mean might not notice? If read_eeprom returns a negative number (which it would if sceSysconCmdExec failed) it means it failed. Any other value would mean it succeeded (and would have the correct value for the eeprom read).

Anyway, it was meant to be a direct replacement for the sceSysconBatteryReadNVM/sceSysconBatteryWriteNVM functions which were taken out of the firmware starting from 3.80. Refer to http://forums.ps2dev.org/viewtopic.php?p=57634#57634 where nem posted the prototypes (the function names werent known when that post was made so they&#039;re labelled sceSyscon_driver_68EF0BEF/sceSyscon_driver_1165C864).

This code was meant for apps using the above functions to be able to work in 3.80+. Ie. pandora apps from cory1492, hellcat, et al. So I would have to make sure the prototypes stayed the same as the original functions and that the code functioned exactly the same as the originals.</description>

		<description>Hi Silverspring,

Nice job and thank you for sharing.

I have notice in the code of read_eeprom, may be a strange behavior if sceSysconCmdExec returns an error, the caller may not notice. I would suggest to do something like:
int read_eeprom(u8 addr, u16 * value)
{
  int res;
  u8 param[0x60];

  if (addr&gt;0x7F) return(0x80000102);

  param[0x0C] = 0x74; // read battery eeprom command
  param[0x0D] = 3; // tx packet length

  // tx data
  param[0x0E] = addr;
  res = sceSysconCmdExec(param, 0);

  if (res</description>

		<description>On maxconsole i have posted a thread about i think something to do with: 
u32 sceSysconCmdExec(void* param, int unk);

The tools from hellcat/cory1492 won&#039;t work with my newest psp. And they use your work in there tools?

		<description>Hi! :-)

Might I ask for permission to use this code snippet in my &quot;Pandora Installer for 3.xx Kernels&quot;?

I&#039;d like to have that working on 3.80 as well ;-)

Propper credits would be given, of course!</description>
